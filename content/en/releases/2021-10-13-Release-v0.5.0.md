# Clusternet Release v0.5.0

🥳🥳🥳 Clusternet Fifth Release !

Clusternet (**Cluster** Inter**net**) is an open source ***add-on*** that helps you manage thousands of millions of Kubernetes clusters as easily as visiting the Internet. No matter the clusters are running on public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or at the edge, Clusternet lets you manage/visit them all as if they were running locally. This also help eliminate the need to juggle different management tools for each cluster.

**Clusternet can also help deploy and coordinate applications to multiple clusters from a single set of APIs in a hosting cluster.**
