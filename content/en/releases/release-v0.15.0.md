On Mar 4th, Clusternet was approved to join CNCF as a Sandbox project. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for the endeavour of the whole
community. It was a HUGE milestone. â›³â›³â›³

This release introduces a new component `clusternet-controller-manager`, which inherits the capabilities
from `clusternet-hub`. With this new component, `clusternet-hub` will focus on serving as an apiserver to provide shadow
APIs and peer connections.

In this release, we also add new features and make multiple enhancements, such as simplifying cobra commands with common
boilerplate codes and use named flagsets, migrating legacy self-cluster lease, adding metrics for Clusternet components,
etc.
