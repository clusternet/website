Installing Clusternet in a [K3S](https://k3s.io/) cluster requires some additional configurations.

#### Set anonymous-auth to false

- If [installed via Helm](/docs/installation/install-with-helm), you need to set `anonymousAuthSupported` to `false` in the value files for clusternet-controller-manager Chart.
- If [manually installing clusternet](/docs/installation/install-the-hard-way), you need to set command line argument `--anonymous-auth=false` for clusternet-controller-manager.

#### Create Serviceaccount Token
- `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clusternet/clusternet/main/manifests/samples/cluster_serviceaccount_token.yaml`
