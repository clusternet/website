This version mainly introduced [OCI-based Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/). Clusternet is the ***first*** project that supports this feature in multiple cluster management. Also unexpected operations (like deleting, updating) that occurred solely inside a child cluster will be rolled back automatically unless those were made explicitly from parent cluster, which kept applications running more stable in child clusters. Kubernetes v1.23 was fully supported as well.

## Changes Since [v0.7.0](https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

Clusternet is the first project that support this feature in multi-cluster management.

A new feature gate named `Recovery` was added as well (by [@dixudx](https://github.com/dixudx) in [#226](https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet/pull/226)).

### Bug Fixes
* Fixing scheduler issue when cluster affinity rules matched no clusters (by [@DanielXLee](https://github.com/DanielXLee) in [#239](https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet/pull/239))
* Fixing nonresource 403 errors (by [@dixudx](https://github.com/dixudx) in [#248](https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet/pull/248))
